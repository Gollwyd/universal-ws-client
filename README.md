Uses the native WebSocket client code in a browser and the [ws package client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ws) on Node.js, enabling isomorphic applications to use WebSockets. Keeps your browser build slim, by not including any of the Node WebSocket implementation.


Installation 
============

```
npm install --save universal-ws-client
```

Usage
=====

```
import WebSocket from 'universal-ws-client';
